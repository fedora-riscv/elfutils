Description: Test for BZ#1059897 (Support 64-bit /SYM64/ symbol table)
Author: Vaclav Kadlcik <vkadlcik@redhat.com>
Bug summary: Support 64-bit /SYM64/ symbol table
Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1059897

Verify that a 64-bit symbol table produced on s390x is readable by elfutils
tools. The test is based on Ed Santiago's examples in Bugzilla; a test file
(libantlr.a) is taken from antlr-C++-2.7.7-30.el7.s390x.rpm. Mark Wielaard
mentioned another test included in the upstream; it gets processed within
../../testsuite (which runs the complete upstream testsuite) so its omission
here is intentional.
